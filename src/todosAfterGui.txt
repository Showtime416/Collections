* first in folder parse: find out when video fails playing and then play the next until found one that is good
* choose image for collection when creating it (via built in icon packs and browse) + modify it later via context menus
* browse/remove sources directly from video context menu (actualy browsing might not be possible? he did it on youtube plugin, need to check)
* video stats context menu
* missing infolabels in most views
* clean up context menus
* Custom icons and titles for each source
* force refresh content menus (both outside and inside item. inside item and maybe also add an item, with other optionsa and settings)
* service/process that runs date estimation algoritm in the background all the time
* New items count for each source (figure out how to calculate and show this)
* settings for all views and counts (also Feed TS in browse sources)
* sort via api in youtube channels
* sort collection feed using the channel api sorts
* increase limit for kodi folders, and if possible find a way to do it for youtube sources as well
* note that currently kodi folders do 3 seperate list requests one after another, this is slow (even when just browsing) and I think also sometimes raises errors in the 2nd/3rd request. see how to solve this, maybe ask the user what is the folder contents,  maybe ask kodi devs how to get all 3 in one request.
* clear cache once a week or so + some kind of protection that checks if script ended. if it didnt 2-3 times in a row, clear cache.
