{"name":"Collection TV","tagline":"Take your Kodi experience to the next step","body":"##Collection TV\r\nCollection TV is a  [Kodi](http://kodi.tv/) add-on which mimics the now discontinued Collections feature in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), while taking it a few steps further. A collection uses multiple sources in order to create one single feed (or in other words, a combined video list). Sources can be YouTube Channels/Playlists, and as of version 2.0, ANY folder inside Kodi. Whether it's a local folder, or a folder inside another add-on, it can be added as a source to your collection.\r\n\r\nYou can use any of the predefined collections or easily create your own.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Links\r\n* [Releases] (https://github.com/SportySpice/Collections/releases)\r\n* [Kodi Forum Thread](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=227806)\r\n* [Future Features & Plans](https://github.com/SportySpice/Collections/wiki/Future-Features-&-Plans)\r\n* [How can you help?](https://github.com/SportySpice/Collections/wiki/How-can-you-help%3F)\r\n* [Collection Creation Guide via XML (completely optional as of version 2.0)](https://github.com/SportySpice/Collections/wiki/Collection-Creation-Guide-(via-XML))\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
