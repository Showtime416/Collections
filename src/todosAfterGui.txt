* first in folder parse: find out when video fails playing and then play the next until found one that is good
* choose image for collection when creating it (via built in icon packs and browse) + modify it later via context menus
* browse/remove sources directly from video context menu (actualy browsing might not be possible? he did it on youtube plugin, need to check)
* video stats context menu
* missing infolabels in most views
* clean up context menus
* Custom icons and titles for each source
* force refresh content menus (both outside and inside item. inside item and maybe also add an item, with other optionsa and settings)
* service/process that runs date estimation algoritm in the background all the time
* New items count for each source (figure out how to calculate and show this)
* settings for all views and counts (also Feed TS in browse sources)
* sort via api in youtube channels
* sort collection feed using the channel api sorts
* increase limit for kodi folders, and if possible find a way to do it for youtube sources as well
* note that currently kodi folders do 3 seperate list requests one after another, this is slow (even when just browsing) and I think also sometimes raises errors in the 2nd/3rd request. see how to solve this, maybe ask the user what is the folder contents,  maybe ask kodi devs how to get all 3 in one request.
* give other developers option to add their own custom counts/sortings by simply adding it to the listitem
* ask if folder contains live streams. if it does, first of all don't estimate dates(or think of something even smarter), and also find an interesting way to present an item which is a live stream, and even give a view that shows live streams only.
* clear cache once a week or so + some kind of protection that checks if script ended. if it didnt 2-3 times in a row, clear cache.
