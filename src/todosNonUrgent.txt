* seperate youtube collections addon
* more parsing methods for kodi folders (local dir list, jsonrpc walk, others?)
* http 500 error
* find out why android version can't load ctypes.pythonapi.PyCell_New as required by dill, or at least keep note to yourself you added code there
* different colors/text settings for queued playlists
* items per page('pagesize' or 'pageitems") instead of climit. Also add options: 'play and queue page" 'play and queue entire collection'
* for sources: instead of just limit. limit and limit per page
* batch resolve + cache videos?
* problem with playcount and lastwatched. do i also store this info for direct plugin videos? do i put this info 
  inside the video class or keep it seperate? need to think of this
* add cool sound when successfully added a source to a collection. (can do either when dialog pops up, or when user presses ok. or both)
* kodi folder titles. currently all 3 use the user defined title. maybe "studioTitle" for example should be the plugin's title
* Add a default collection to my collections via context menu, or in browse mode
* Add specific videos to a collection (all will go under a special "source" folder called "individual media' or "individual items" or something
* Enable/Disable video fanart (currently disabled)
* Playlist videos fanart from channel instead of playlist
* Presentation improvements (addon icon, addon fanart, text styles, etc) 
* Individual unwatched: set unwatched for specific sources instead of entire collection (needed?)
* maybe change to browsing dialog in add to collection to a select dialog
* currently all api calls are made via oauth(if user signed in). check if this is really needed or
  is it better to just use public key for most requests
* Super/Sub Collections: create a collection of collections
* cache service for better performance?
* Performance improvements by imporoving caching functions (video info, source info, video lists, etc)
* Performance imrpovements by removing 3rd party libraries and using only needed code
* Nag Kodi devs to add DASH support so we can all enjoy 1080p/4k/60fps streams
