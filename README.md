####CollectionTV
CollectionTV is a  [Kodi](http://kodi.tv/) add-on which mimics the now discontinued Collections feature in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), while taking it a few steps further. A collection uses multiple sources in order to create one single feed, or in other words, a combined video list. Sources can be YouTube Channels/Playlists, and as of version 2.0, ANY folder inside. Whether it's a local folder, or a folder inside another add-on, it can be added as a source to your collection.

You can use any of the predefined collections or easily create your own collections as explained in the wiki.
